Before each turn, you have the option of betting $1, calling (no bet), or folding (ending the hand). If you bet, the computer may call or fold, depending on it's hand. After deciding on one of these three, you have the chance to replace 3 of the cards in you hand. Do by clicking on the cards you want to replace (0-3), and the pressing the Finished button.  You win when the computer is out of money. GOOD LUCK!";
